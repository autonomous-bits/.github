## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Teams and Permissions
Create GitHub teams and assign repository permissions:
```bash
# Create teams (requires organization admin)
gh api orgs/autonomous-bits/teams -f name="platform-core" -f description="Core Platform Team"
gh api orgs/autonomous-bits/teams -f name="ai-agents" -f description="AI Agents Team"
gh api orgs/autonomous-bits/teams -f name="developer-tools" -f description="Developer Tools Team"
gh api orgs/autonomous-bits/teams -f name="platform-users" -f description="Platform Users"
```

### 2. Apply Repository Settings
For each repository, configure:
- Branch protection rules
- Required status checks
- Security scanning
- Issue/PR templates

### 3. Set Up Repository Labels
Apply consistent labels across all repositories using GitHub CLI or API.

### 4. Upload Configuration Files
Upload the created organizational files to the `.github` repository:

```bash
# Clone and push organization config
git clone git@github.com:autonomous-bits/.github.git
cd .github
# Copy files from github-org-config/ directory
git add .
git commit -m "Add organizational structure and workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 5. Begin Development
Start with the foundation repositories in this order:
1. `platform-sdk-typescript` (base library)
2. `infrastructure-orchestrator` (core platform)
3. `mcp-server` (AI integration)
4. `iac-cli` (developer interface)

## 🔧 Repository Management Commands

### List All Repositories
```bash
gh repo list autonomous-bits --limit 50
```

### Clone All Repositories
```bash
# Create script to clone all repos
for repo in infrastructure-orchestrator mcp-server output-registry stamp-registry multi-repo-coordinator llm-agent-engine multi-repo-planner cross-team-coordinator governance-validator drift-detector remediation-agent iac-cli stamp-generator environment-composer dependency-visualizer platform-sdk-typescript stamp-templates platform-docs .github; do
  gh repo clone autonomous-bits/$repo
done
```

### Set Up Local Development Environment
```bash
# Create workspace directory
mkdir autonomous-bits-workspace
cd autonomous-bits-workspace

# Clone all repositories
# ... (use clone script above)

# Set up development environment for each repo
# (specific setup instructions in each repository's README)
```

## 🎉 Completion Status

**✅ COMPLETE**: All repositories and organizational structure have been successfully created!

The Autonomous Infrastructure Platform is now ready for development. All 18 core repositories plus the organizational `.github` repository are in place with proper descriptions and private visibility.

You can now begin implementing the platform starting with the foundation services and building up through the dependency tiers.
